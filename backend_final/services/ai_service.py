EVALUATION CRITERIA (each 0-10):
1. depth - How thorough and deep is the thinking? (1-3 = shallow/surface-level, 4-6 = moderate, 7-10 = deep analysis)
2. accuracy - Is the content factually correct against the source material? (1-3 = significant errors, 4-6 = partially correct, 7-10 = accurate)
3. application - Does the student apply concepts to real scenarios? (1-3 = no application, 4-6 = basic, 7-10 = strong practical application)
4. originality - Is this the student's OWN thinking or does it read like AI/ChatGPT output?

CRITICAL ORIGINALITY RULES:
- If an answer is overly polished, uses generic academic phrasing, or reads like it was generated by ChatGPT/AI, give originality 1-3
- Signs of AI-generated text: perfect grammar, formulaic structure like "In conclusion", "Furthermore", "It is important to note", generic examples, no personal voice
- Signs of genuine student work: personal examples, informal language, specific references to class/textbook, occasional grammar mistakes, unique perspective
- A copy-pasted answer should get originality 0-2
- Only give originality 7+ if the answer shows genuine personal insight or creative thinking

5. confidence - How confident does the student appear? (1-3 = very uncertain/hedging, 4-6 = moderate, 7-10 = confident and assertive)
- Signs of low confidence: "I think maybe", "I'm not sure but", "probably", excessive hedging
- Signs of high confidence: direct statements, specific claims, assertive language

Based on their SPECIFIC weaknesses, generate a PERSONALIZED learning pathway. 
DO NOT give generic advice like "study more" or "practice regularly".
Instead, give SPECIFIC, ACTIONABLE recommendations tied to this assessment's topic.

Example of BAD (generic): "Focus on improving analytical skills"
Example of GOOD (specific): "Practice deriving the gravitational force equation for non-point masses, then solve problems involving satellite orbital mechanics"
